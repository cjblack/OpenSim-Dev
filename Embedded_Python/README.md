#Embedding Python 

I am currently integrating python with OpenSim.

Currently, there is just a test file available to make sure that a Python file can be called and executed.

This will extend into calling a few basic scripts for plotting and storing data, but eventually, & hopefully, this will evolve into a higher level of embedding to have a more fluid/seamless bidirectional communication.
